# Slider

### Introduction
In this challenge you will begin to familiarize yourself with the concept of *Component*, since each slide can be considered as such.
The goal is to allow users to navigate through the slides. To do this, the app must have transitions, that is, move to the next slide or return to the previous one, and, in turn, give users the option to choose a specific slide using selection bullets that also indicate which one is active at that moment.

### Extra mile:
Can you add actions so that the slider works in a tactile way or plays automatically and users can choose when to pause or restart the transition?
