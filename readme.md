## Useful information

#### How to run the project?

Our recommendation is to run the main project or any of the challenges using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

#### Projects structure

Every challenge folder has pretty much the same structure (except for some exceptions), but normally it's something like this...

    Project folder...
    â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ js              # The Javascript files of the project
    â””â”€â”€ scss            # The project styles configuration
    â””â”€â”€ index.html      # The main HTML file
    â””â”€â”€ styles.css      # The minified styles
    â””â”€â”€ readme.md       # The readme folder including the challenge instructions
    â””â”€â”€ ...

#### Styles compilation

All of them have an **scss** folder which includes all of the project stylesheets. In order to compile them you should be positioned on the root directory and run the following commands.

If you're using npm...

```shell
npm run sass $1
```

If you're using yarn...

```shell
yarn run sass $1
```

**$1** is the expected argument of the command which references the project you want to compile.
Eg: `yarn run sass Rock` This will compille all of the _Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock_ project styles.
